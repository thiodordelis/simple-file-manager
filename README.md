simple-file-manager
===================
This is a fork of https://github.com/jcampbell1/simple-file-manager.

A Simple PHP file manager.  The code is a single php file.  

Just copy `index.php` to a folder on your webserver.

## Why it is good

- Single file, there are no images, or css folders.  
- Ajax based so it is fast, but doesn't break the back button
- Allows drag and drop file uploads if folder is writable by the webserver
- Suits my aesthetics.  More like Dropbox, and less like Windows Explorer
- Works with Unicode file names
- The interface is usable from an iPad
- XSRF protection (though no authentication system)
